# Optimisation-and-Data-Analytics

Implement a method for the graphical solution of LP problems with two decision variables.
The procedure takes as input the objective function, the two variables, and the constraints,
and first generates a graphical representation of the feasible region. In the second step, the
objective function is represented as a line demonstrating the optimal solution. The solution is
also outputted. Test your approach on real-world data (see at the end). Ensure that you also
implement error handling. (3-4 people)
